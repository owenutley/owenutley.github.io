            Game 1: using Flicker Flame (owen), Lightning (kaden), and earth 
            defender (gabe) three of the four starting low difficulty 
            characters. Easy game finishing around round 7 or 8 of 12. Very 
            easy game done on difficulty 0 with no adversary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Game 2: Using Memory (owen), volcano (parker), rock blight (kaden) 
            and inland creature (gabe) beat another game with no adversary. 
            Still a very easy game finishing around round 7. Easy game, little 
            need for large colaboration efforts. Mostly stuck to dealing with 
            our own space.
        </p>

            Game 3: using fire blight (ian), fire lizard (owen), mist (kaden), 
            earth defender (gabe) low and path finder (parker), on a stage 4 
            difficulty against scottland. We had slow starting game, coast 
            build up happened too fast and we weren't able to slow them down 
            in time to do efficient damage in the later game. We lost around 
            round 7 due to blight on the island.

                Game 4: Played with the ocean and Bringer of nightmares. I alone
                played on a level 4 brandenburg Prussia adversary. felt a little 
                overwhelmed in the mid game. I noticed I used bringer wrong a few 
                times by destroying troops rather than generating fear. I almost 
                lost to blight but had a close call finish by generating a ton of 
                fear in the endgame. literally saved by the ocean generating 
                massive anounts of fear using a card that was giving a fear card 
                each turn.

            Game 5: Played with Keeper (owen) and lightning (corinne). we 
            played against lvl 2 England. Team combination felt very good. 
            We focussed on removing invaders from the inlands and pushing them 
            to the coast. We generated fear slow because there wasn't a lot to 
            destroy early on, but we chose to let the coast build so we could 
            come back with some strong powers. Keeper was very good at 
            cornering the invaders and preventing their exploration. lightning 
            was good as usual for destroying the buildings before growth and 
            ravage phases. Lightning also made good use of powers to clear 
            blight quickly before invaders could make a mess. Spirit combo 
            was good, with lightning allowing keeper for some fast movements, 
            and Keeper allowed lightning to gain power cards and energy 
            frequently. We also played with the branch claw expansion only. We 
            included the scenario card that has the extra markers on the board 
            for uncovering for benefits. Only two cards were ever uncovered. 
            First by the invaders who would explore and build when in wetlands 
            and we uncovered ability #8 which happens once, instantly. Don't 
            remember what is even did.

            Game 6: Stone's unyielding defiance, keeper of the forbidden 
            wilds. Played this game on my own against Habsburg Monarchy lvl 2. 
            Game started slow. Spent most time trying to avoid letting the 
            island blight. After enough build up, just started destroying 
            everything. difficult game early on but finished very strong. 
            Winning a victory on fear 2. Finished playing 6 cards a turn with 
            keepar and just tormenting the invaders.

            Game 7: Played alone with the flying beast card and the panther 
            beast card against. lvl 4 sweeden. Took about 5 invader turns for 
            me to loose. Both spirits seemed powerful but I don't think i used 
            them nearly as effectively as I could. I don't like the flying 
            spirits growth track. it feels like it makes things move too slowly. 
            Both have powerful movement and fear creation but the fear cards 
            collected were almost useless in this particular game. I would 
            definitely say after playing that round that sharp fangs behind 
            leaves was a more useful spirit overall. But if you are looking for 
            a fast start many minds move as one would likely be better because 
            all the 0 cost cards they start with. May have been better if I 
            would have used more major powers.

            Game 8: Played the snake and rain bird against scottland. Lost with 
            extra loose condition on the build coastal round. really hard to 
            start and keep up without loosing quickly. Snake has incredible 
            defensive card but served little use without a way to manitpulate 
            dahan better than I could. Rain bird allowed me to repeat defensive 
            cards to keep from blighting but dealing damage was next to 
            impossible. I think maybe my recent losses have shown that I have 
            been trying to develop presence on the board too quickly, while 
            lacking in early game power cards and energy in order to keep from 
            failing to one of the game's loose conditions. spirits with tracks 
            that allow less presence growth would probably suit my play style 
            better.

            Game 9: Played with Keeper and Serpent. Both were relatively slow 
            starting but late game was using cards like no other. I need to 
            check a rule to see if card repeating card repeat cards is allowed. 
            Went against Scottland and their coast again. felt hard for a while 
            but after a little bit felt very powerful. Didn't finish the game but 
            would still consider it a win.

            for uncovering for benefits. Only two cards were ever uncovered. 
            First by the invaders who would explore and build when in wetlands 
            and we uncovered ability #8 which happens once, instantly. Don't 
            remember what is even did.
