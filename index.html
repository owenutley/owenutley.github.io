            Game 1: using the four startin low difficulty characters. 
            Easy game finishing around round 7 or 8 of 12. Very easy 
            game done on difficulty 0 with no adversary.

            Game 2: Using Memory, volcano, rock blight and inland creature 
            beat another game with no adversary. Still a very easy game 
            finishing around round 7. Easy game, little need for large 
            colaboration efforts. Mostly stuck to dealing with our own space.

            Game 3: using fire blight, fire lizard, mist, earth defender low 
            and path finder, on a stage 4 difficulty against scottland. We 
            had slow starting game, coast buildup happened too fast and we 
            weren't able to slow them down in time to do efficient damage in 
            the later game. We lost around round 7 due to blight on the 
            island.
